# `gamgee` - Django blog engine

`gamgee` is a naive, but robust blogging engine written in Python 3 using the Django 1.9 web framework. Most of the code is based on the excellent Django blogging tutorial by Matthew Daly which can be found on his [blog](http://http://matthewdaly.co.uk/). A have added code and left out code depending on my needs.

The source code is available under the GPL v2.0 licence.
